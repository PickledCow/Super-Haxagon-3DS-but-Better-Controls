# ![Icon](./resource/icon.png "Icon") Super-Haxagon

Super Haxagon is a [Super Hexagon](http://superhexagon.com/) clone for the 3DS. It runs full speed on the old 3DS, new 3DS, and in [citra-emu/citra](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra). 

### FAQ

#### Q: How do I download this?
A: Downloads are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/RedInquisitive/Super-Haxagon/releases).

#### Q: How can I create my own levels?
A: You can use [Haxa-Editor](https://github.com/RedInquisitive/Haxa-Editor/tree/master)! Follow the directions in the README.md of that repository for more details.

#### Q: I made this really cool level, can I show you?
A: Of course you can! If it's really good I'll add it to the game!

#### Q: Can I use my own music/levels?
A: Yes! See the readme in the [sdmc folder](https://github.com/RedInquisitive/Super-Haxagon/tree/master/sdmc) for more details.

#### Q: It says "AWW SNAP!" whenever I launch the game or press B on the main menu!
A: OK, that's not a question, but please look in the root of your SD card for the file "haxapanic.txt" and read it. If it does not answer your question, file a bug report here.

#### Q: Why do sound effects work, but in-game music does not?
A: See the readme in the [sdmc folder](https://github.com/RedInquisitive/Super-Haxagon/tree/master/sdmc).

#### Q: Why is there no audio at all?
A: You need to dump your DSP firmware! Normally this is covered when installing A9LH through [3ds.guide](https://3ds.guide/installing-arm9loaderhax#section-vi---finalizing-setup)'s "Section VI - Finalizing setup". If it is not, Launch the Homebrew Launcher from the home menu and select “DSP Dump”.

#### Q: Why did you rewrite the whole thing?
A: Because!

#### Q: Can I play this on my PC?
A: You should buy [Super Hexagon](http://superhexagon.com/) and support the original creator!

#### Q: But I want to play YOUR version on PC!
A: Have you ever heard of [citra-emu/citra](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra)? (Make sure to enable "scaled resolution" for the best experience)!
